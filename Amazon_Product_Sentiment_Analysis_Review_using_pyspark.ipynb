    "This project is aimed towards understanding the sentiment of customer reviews in different social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When customer likes and dislikes a product, it is highly likely that they post their review in their Twitter or FaceBook or any ther social platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to build a model that is trained with the known positve and negative customer reviews from Amazon's Healthcare and personla care products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Description**\n",
    "1. We want to know what is the postive and negative sentiments are. With Amazon's product review, we associate 4,5 ratings as positive, and 1, 2 ratings ar negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We want to focus only on Healthcare and Personal care products only. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we train our model and choose from the models trained?**\n",
    "We experiemnt with different ML algorithms suh as Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest to classify our sentiments as positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the precision score, we choose our model after performing Hyper parameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the impact of our project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all the customers reach Customer Care when they face a trouble with the product that they recently purchased. Additionally not all customers write reviews. It would be worse for amazon if customers leave negative comments regarding their products on social media and amazon doesn't keep track of it the way it is able to for the reviews left on its website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using sentiment analysis, we can predict negative sentiments in customer reviews. This negative sentiments could be used to rectify the problem/issue that the customer is facing. We hope to use the same model to eventually run sentiment analysis on references made to amazon products on social media platforms where there is no review or rating readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps in increasing customer satisfaction while increasing the range of purchase of the existing customers."

They had one open so you could try it out.  I only tried it for less than 10 minutes but that was enough.  Personally I think this is one of the worst ideas I have seen in a long time that is a product of one of those annoying TV commercials.  The idea of it is that it supposed to be easier to hold this thing over your book and hover it there continuously while you read, as opposed to just wearing glasses, ....Or something. (I think a newer model I saw on TV recently has a light, but that doesn't come off as any improvement on it in my opinion).  No question that if you get this thing just right it can magnify the page of your book or whatever it is you are using it for, but the fact that it actually works is where the benefits of this thing ends.  For starters, even if you are not reading one of the books that requires two hands for it closes on you the second you relax your grip on it,(as most of them are), this thing has to be positioned just right all the time in order to magnify the page successfully.  Move it back and forth just a little and your page becomes a blur.  There are no attachments to this thing, your hand is the tool, and in no time you start to have it get tired, go to sleep, etc.  There is not even a handle anywhere on this thing.  You just hold it someplace along the edge where you can sometimes find yourself magnifying nothing but your own finger.  Lastly, this thing is not glare resistant.  Depending on your light source, you will occasionally have to move or adjust it just to see.  Or better yet, forget about it it all together which is what I suggest overall.  There are several of these page magnifiers available here on Amazon.  The cheaper ones are much smaller.  Actually, I think a smaller ones is a wiser investment than this more expensive full page model.  The smaller one can be a handy tool to have around when you are trying to read that horrible tiny print on such things as medicine bottles, instructions, etc.  And its much cheaper than this model.  No matter what you have in mind for this Mighty Bright, I suggest you move on.  My experience with it was that is nothing but aggravating, poorly designed, and a waste of money...\", overall=1, summary='...Wear Glasses And Forget This', unixReviewTime='1306627200', reviewTime='05 29, 2011')]"

After several times of doing this, the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small, but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant, this is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |4.0    |[i, would, recommend, this, for, a, travel, magnifier, for, the, occasional, reading.i, had, read, on, another, review, about, a, magnifier, having, a, problem, with, the, light, coming, on., i, did, find, that, this, one, appeared, to, be, doa, out, of, the, box., but,, after, opening, &, shutting, the, viewer, to, turn, on, &, off, the, light,, the, light, began, to, come, on., after, several, times, of, doing, this,, the, light, appears, to, be, coming, on, all, the, time.it, is, small,, but, for, taking, it, someplace, &, reading, things, like, a, menu, in, a, dark, corner, of, a, restaurant,, this, is, great.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |(3,[0,1],[8.0,2.0])       |\n",
      "|What I liked was the quality of the lens and the built in light.  Then lens had no discernable distortion anywhere.  It magnified everything evenly without the ripples and  distortion that I've seen with other low cost magnifiers.  This light is a nice touch and easy to use.  If you want it on just pull the lens out a bit.  It is focused very close to the center of what you will be look at and provides nice, even coverage.What I didn't like was the brightness (actually dimmness) of the light and where it is focused.  LEDs can be lots brighter, I know as I've seen them.  Also, the light focuses at the center of you field of view but only when the lens is too close to be focused properly.Bottom line is this is a good value for a magnifier and could have been made great with better quality control.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.|4.0    |[what, i, liked, was, the, quality, of, the, lens, and, the, built, in, light., , then, lens, had, no, discernable, distortion, anywhere., , it, magnified, everything, evenly, without, the, ripples, and, , distortion, that, i've, seen, with, other, low, cost, magnifiers., , this, light, is, a, nice, touch, and, easy, to, use., , if, you, want, it, on, just, pull, the, lens, out, a, bit., , it, is, focused, very, close, to, the, center, of, what, you, will, be, look, at, and, provides, nice,, even, coverage.what, i, didn't, like, was, the, brightness, (actually, dimmness), of, the, light, and, where, it, is, focused., , leds, can, be, lots, brighter,, i, know, as, i've, seen, them., , also,, the, light, focuses, at, the, center, of, you, field, of, view, but, only, when, the, lens, is, too, close, to, be, focused, properly.bottom, line, is, this, is, a, good, value, for, a, magnifier, and, could, have, been, made, great, with, better, quality, control.btw,, i, feel, that, honest,, effective, reviews, can, take, the, place, of, first-hand, experiences, that, are, lacking, in, online, shopping., i've, always, appreciated, the, help, i've, received, from, other, reviewers, and, work, hard, to, return, the, favor, as, best, as, i, can., , i, hope, you, found, this, review, helpful, and, if, there, was, anything, you, thought, was, lacking, or, unclear, leave, a, comment, and, i'll, do, what, i, can, to, fix, it.]|(3,[0,1,2],[14.0,7.0,9.0])|\n",

      "|Seems to be a legit 3X.  I bought my first and everything perfect.  So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned (really dim, flickering).  Before I sent it back, I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are, took them out, but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit(uses 2 small watch-like ones) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off, and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well (it's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little).  After that, put the batteries back in and it works like my good one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |5.0    |[seems, to, be, a, legit, 3x., , i, bought, my, first, and, everything, perfect., , so, i, bought, a, 2nd, for, my, nephew, -, but, that, one, had, the, light, issue, someone, else, mentioned, (really, dim,, flickering)., , before, i, sent, it, back,, i, wanted, to, check, the, batteries, -, so, i, unscrewed, where, they, are,, took, them, out,, but, it, looked, like, the, contact, on, the, right, battery, on, the, unit(uses, 2, small, watch-like, ones), had, some, kind, of, grime, on, it, -, wiped, that, off,, and, i, also, bent, the, little, tab, to, stick, out, a, little, more, to, give, it, a, better, contact, on, the, battery, -, did, that, for, the, other, side, as, well, (it's, different, because, of, the, +/-, but, you, can, bend, both, sides, out, a, little)., , after, that,, put, the, batteries, back, in, and, it, works, like, my, good, one.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |(3,[0,1,2],[10.0,6.0,3.0])|\n",
      "|I'll admit it.  I fought like crazy when people started suggesting that I get a magnifying glass.  Yes, I could no longer some menu descriptions, especially in low light.  And when I needed to see the model number on an electronic device's sticker, and couldn't, well, that was a problem too.  After I accepted that I had a problem, I refused to get an old-fashioned magnifier, like my mother uses.  So, I looked around and this caught my eye (haha).

This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this, try it.  It will meet your needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |5.0    |[i, got, two, of, these, -, one, for, my, mom, and, one, for, my, mother-in-law,, both, in, their, 80s., , what, i, wonder, is, why, i, didn't, get, one, for, me?, , i, will, be, wanting, to, order, another, for, myself., , these, were, a, big, hit, for, these, ladies, and, so, useful., , as, we, age,, we, need, more, light, to, see, what, was, once, easy, for, us, to, read., , often, we, are, in, areas, where, the, lighting, is, poor, or, minimal., , this, answers, that, need., , if, you, are, looking, for, a, product, like, this,, try, it., , it, will, meet, your, needs.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |(3,[0,1,2],[1.0,4.0,2.0]) |\n",

      "|This is a great little portable magnifier with light.  I bought 2 of them so I could keep one in my purse and have one for my desk.  However, my husband liked the blue one so much he took off with one and now I need to re-order!It is slightly curved so it feels good in your grip.  Closed, it measures about as long as your standard full-sized desktop mouse and about a half inch thick.  The viewing glass area is about as big as the face/screen of a flip style cell phone.  When open it emits an impressively strong light that works like a champ in the darkest of rooms. As it is an LED light it should have a very long operating life as LEDs don't require a lot of power.  Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |5.0    |[this, is, a, great, little, portable, magnifier, with, light., , i, bought, 2, of, them, so, i, could, keep, one, in, my, purse, and, have, one, for, my, desk., , however,, my, husband, liked, the, blue, one, so, much, he, took, off, with, one, and, now, i, need, to, re-order!it, is, slightly, curved, so, it, feels, good, in, your, grip., , closed,, it, measures, about, as, long, as, your, standard, full-sized, desktop, mouse, and, about, a, half, inch, thick., , the, viewing, glass, area, is, about, as, big, as, the, face/screen, of, a, flip, style, cell, phone., , when, open, it, emits, an, impressively, strong, light, that, works, like, a, champ, in, the, darkest, of, rooms., as, it, is, an, led, light, it, should, have, a, very, long, operating, life, as, leds, don't, require, a, lot, of, power., , presumably, the, battery, could, be, changed, if, needed, as, there, is, a, small, door, with, a, single, screw, located, behind, where, the, light, is, housed., , 5, stars!]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |(3,[0,1,2],[6.0,3.0,3.0]) |\n",
