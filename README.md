# PySpark_sentiment_analysis
Sentiment analysis of large dataset using PySpark

## Performed the following operations in PySpark.
1. Created Spark context to read  large input data file
2. Basic Data Exploration
3. Data cleaning
4. TFIDF using Tokenizer
5. Count Vectorizer

## Conclusion:
1. Datasets are processed faster in PySpark in comparison to traditional sentiment analysis performed in Colab notebook with the help of classical algorithms.
2. Although the accuracy of classification of sentiments is not great, this project introduces to PySpark and its usage.
